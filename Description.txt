This library provides general tools for manipulation of generic pixel arrays.
Key concepts are the Iterators, the Hyper Cubes and the Regions.
The Hyper Cubes in their implementation as Pixel Cubes provide generalization of
 N-dimensional images.
The Hyper Cubes in their implementation as Vector Cubes provide generalization of
Structuring Elements. The Regions provide the pixel neighborhood around a given pixel
defined by a Vector Cube.
